# Important: Duplicate File Deletion Required

There's a critical build issue with duplicate file declarations in this directory.

## Action Required

Please **delete** the following file to fix the build error:

```
pkg/middleware/responsewriter.go
```

Reason: This file contains duplicate declarations of the `responseWriterWrapper` type and its methods, which are already defined in `response_writer.go`.

After deleting this file, the build should succeed.

## Error Details

Currently the build fails with these errors:

```
responseWriterWrapper redeclared in this block
other declaration of responseWriterWrapper
method responseWriterWrapper.Header already declared
method responseWriterWrapper.Write already declared
method responseWriterWrapper.WriteHeader already declared
method responseWriterWrapper.Flush already declared
```

These errors occur because Go does not allow the same type and methods to be declared multiple times in the same package.
